# Cool Calendar :P

This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

### Installation
```
$  yarn install or npm install
```

### Run
```
$  yarn start or npm start
```

### Run tests
```
$  yarn test  or npm test
```

### Mandatory Features
- [x] Add reminder
- [x] Display reminders on the calendar in the correct order
- [x] Allow select and show propertly the color
- [ ] Edit reminder (**I could not finish this task**)
- [x] Call weather API (You have to use a valid city e.g. Bogota, Pereira, London, Lima )
- [ ] Unit tests for add reminder (**Partially**, I finished only Redux tests for add reminder)
  

### Bonus
- [x] Support more than 1 month
- [ ] Propertly handle overflow in a day (**Partially**, you can see the text *n more* hidden items, but you can't visualize them)
- [x] Delete 1 or ALL reminders per day (Delete 1 reminder at once)

### Considerations
- [x] Use Redux or something similar
- [x] Focus only in front end part
- [x] Use git
- [x] Use helper libraries (I used moment, react-color, react-datepicker and react-bootstrap)
